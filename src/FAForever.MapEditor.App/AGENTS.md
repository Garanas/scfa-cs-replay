# Agent guide: FAForever.MapEditor.App

The map editor's window (`faf-map-editor`, Avalonia 12, Fluent theme, dark). The repository-wide
guide is [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md); everything about maps (the document, the project
format, undo, brushes, saving and reloading) is in the library and its guide,
[`../FAForever.MapEditor.Project/AGENTS.md`](../FAForever.MapEditor.Project/AGENTS.md). Keep this
project thin: what the menu does, the library does.

```sh
dotnet run --project src/FAForever.MapEditor.App -- [folder] [--automation 5371]
```

The folder is a project (it holds `map.json`) or a map folder of the game, which is imported
once the workspace is ready.

## Every feature: the checklist

The editor is built to be checked and used by agents as well as people. A feature is done when it
keeps that up; go through this list with every change to the window, not only at the end:

1. **Automation**: every operation a person can do (a menu item, a button, a key, a mouse gesture
   with a meaning) has an automation command that does the same through the view model, listed
   in `help`, in `AutomationServer`'s summary and under Automation below. What the feature shows
   or holds is in `state` (or its own command when it is large).
2. **Labels**: every new control one can read or use gets `AutomationProperties.Name` (and
   `HelpText` when its use is not obvious), unless its own text says what it is. A new kind of
   control (one `UiTree` does not know as usable, or whose text it cannot read) gets a line in
   `Automation/UiTree.cs`, so `ui` describes it.
3. **Tests**: the operation in `MainViewModelTest` (or the library's tests), and its input in
   `MainWindowTest` (headless: the mouse, keys, what the view then shows). A view drawn on the
   graphics card is checked with automation in a real editor instead (`screenshot gpu=true`).
4. **Performance**: work that grows with the map, or runs per frame or per mouse move, gets a
   span (`Performance.Measure`); check `perf` before and after on the 81 km and the decal-heavy
   test maps. Nothing per frame touches the disk; a hidden view does no work.
5. **Check it running**: in a test editor on port 5372 with `FAF_MAP_EDITOR_SETTINGS` pointing
   at a settings file of its own, read `ui` and `state`, and look at a screenshot.
6. **Look**: the views use tokens and style classes, never loose values (UI rules below); a
   change of look updates the snapshots on purpose (`UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1`), checked by eye.
7. **This guide**: what the feature does and its rules, where a later reader looks for them.

The project skill `.claude/skills/editor-ui` holds the same rules in short, for agents.

## UI rules: one look, kept in one place

Fluent (Avalonia's theme, dark) draws the controls; the editor's own look lives in `Styles/`:

- `Styles/Tokens.axaml`, the design tokens: the palette, the brushes named after their use
  (`CanvasBrush`, `SurfaceBrush`, `SurfaceRaisedBrush`, `TextSecondaryBrush`, `TextTertiaryBrush`,
  `TextDisabledBrush`, `DangerBrush`, `Overlay*Brush`), per theme variant, and the sizes
  (`FontSize*`, `Space*`, `*Padding`, `*Gap`, `*Width`). The accent is pinned (`AccentColor`,
  through Fluent's palette), so the editor looks the same on every computer.
- `Styles/Classes.axaml`, the classes the views say what a thing is with: text `title`,
  `heading`, `lead`, `secondary`, `caption`, `error`, `undone`, `item`; surfaces `Border.panel`,
  `Border.bar`; layout `StackPanel.page` (`wide`), `StackPanel.stack`, `section` (a gap before),
  `Button.beside`.
- `Styles/Controls.axaml`, the control themes of the editor's own controls (`Section`: a
  heading with its content).
- Reusable pieces are controls: `Controls/FolderField` (a folder to choose: heading,
  explanation, path, Browse, with the labels for screen readers), `Controls/Section`. A pattern
  used twice becomes one.
- The views are split by what they are: `MainWindow` (menu, status bar, the two map views, the
  pages by stage), `SidePanel` (brush, history), `SetupPage`, `UpdateAssetsPage`,
  `ConvertingPage`.
- Code that draws (the overlays of the top view, the 3D view's sky) reads the tokens with
  `TryFindResource` and reads them again when the theme variant changes. Only colours that come
  from the map (a marker's) are made in code.
- `StyleRulesTest` fails on a colour, font size or weight, opacity or non-zero distance written
  in a view or control, and on a fixed colour in their code. `SnapshotTest` draws the setup page,
  the assets page and the editor with HardFFA headless (Skia, Inter, 1280 by 800) and compares
  them with `tests/FAForever.MapEditor.App.Tests/snapshots/*.png` (a channel may differ by 24, 0.2 %
  of the pixels may differ); a failure writes the new picture into the tests' output
  (`snapshot-results/`). Look at it, and run the tests with `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1` to accept it.
- Avalonia's documentation is at hand through the `avalonia-docs` MCP server (`.mcp.json`):
  ask it before writing Avalonia code from memory; WPF habits and older versions differ.

## The start: workspace first

The editor works in a workspace (the library's guide explains it). `MainViewModel.StartAsync`
reads the remembered one (`UserSettings`) and sets the window's `Stage`:

- `SetUp`: no workspace, or the remembered one is gone. A page asks for the workspace folder, the
  game, FAF's data and the vault, filled in from FAF's `fa_path.lua`; `SetUpWorkspaceAsync` checks
  them, creates the workspace, remembers it and converts the assets.
- `UpdateAssets`: the assets are missing or outdated (a new `.nx2` from FAF, another editor
  version); the page says why, and its button converts them.
- `Converting`: a progress bar. The editor waits until it is done; closing the window stops the
  conversion, and the next start goes on where it was.
- `Ready`: the editor. Open and Save As start in the workspace's `projects`, Import in the vault's
  `maps`, and Export writes into the vault's `maps` without asking.

The menu and the editor are hidden until `Ready`. To try the start without touching your own
workspace, point `FAF_MAP_EDITOR_SETTINGS` at another settings file.

## Structure

- `ViewModels/MainViewModel`: the window without the window. It holds the `EditedMap`, the
  brush settings and every operation of the menu as a plain method that takes its folder
  (`OpenAsync`, `LoadProjectAsync`, `ImportMapFolderAsync`, `SaveAsync`, `SaveAsAsync`,
  `ExportAsync`, `Undo`, `Redo`, `BeginStroke`,
  `ContinueStroke`, `EndStroke`, `Stroke`). The menu's commands ask for the folder first
  (`IEditorDialogs`), then call those methods; automation and tests call them directly. It uses no
  Avalonia types, so `tests/FAForever.MapEditor.App.Tests` tests it without a window.
- Opening, importing, saving and exporting are asynchronous (`LoadProjectAsync`,
  `ImportMapFolderAsync`, `SaveAsync`, `SaveAsAsync`, `ExportAsync`): they read and write on a pool
  thread while `IsBusy` disables the commands that cannot run alongside. Painting goes on during a
  save; reloads wait until a save or stroke ends. Keep the user interface's thread free of work
  that grows with the map: a full redraw of the view runs its rows in parallel.
- `Controls/HeightmapView`: the terrain from above, one pixel per sample, shaded and coloured by
  height and water (`Rendering/TerrainPicture`), with the mask of the
  layer being painted in orange; it draws again only the tiles a change touched. The markers lie
  over it at a fixed size on screen in the colour of their kind (spawns circles with their
  number, deposits squares, AI markers diamonds, weather triangles, path nodes dots with their
  links; View menu). Left mouse paints (a stroke is an `EditTransaction`, so one undo step, shown
  while it is painted), right or middle mouse moves, the wheel zooms around the cursor.
- `Controls/TerrainViewGpu` (the 3D tab): the map on the graphics card with OpenGL through
  Avalonia's `OpenGlControlBase` (ANGLE, OpenGL ES 3.0, on Windows; OpenGL 3.3 elsewhere), bound
  with Silk.NET. The camera (`Rendering/Gpu/EditorCamera`, tested without a window) works as the
  FAF map editor's (`Assets/Scripts/Camera/CameraControler*.cs`): it starts straight down over
  the whole map; the wheel moves it along the ray under the mouse, towards what the mouse points
  at, three steps of 3.3 % of 2.6 times the distance to the ground a notch (out: straight back),
  from 4.5 to 11 000 ogrids; the middle mouse button drags the ground with the mouse; space and
  the mouse turn it around the pivot and tilt it from straight down (pitch 90) to 10 degrees
  above the horizon; F focuses on the place under the mouse (the FAF editor focuses on the
  selection; there is none yet), from about half as far; Home shows the whole map again. It
  glides to where it is sent (only while the 3D view draws), and its pivot is always the ground
  it looks at. The left mouse button is left for editing.
  - The camera belongs to the view model (`MainViewModel.Camera`, `CameraMoved`), so both views
    share it: the top view draws what it sees (its footprint on the ground, the eye and a line to
    the pivot; View menu), and control and a click there sends it to that place at once. Opening
    a map puts it over the whole map. The status bar shows the place under the mouse in both
    views (`EditorCamera.PointAt` on the terrain itself in 3D).
  - That ground is the terrain blurred (`Rendering/Gpu/SmoothGround`: averages over squares of
    8, 16, 32, ... ogrids, read between their centres and between sizes), over about 15 % of the
    camera's distance (8 to 2048 ogrids): spikes and cliffs do not throw the camera up and down,
    and from close by it still follows hills. Only the eye keeps 2 ogrids clear of the terrain
    itself. The view makes it again when the heights change, at most twice a second. `Rendering/Gpu/TerrainRenderer` draws the terrain, then the albedo decals, the
  normal decals and the water; `TerrainShaders` follows the FAF map editor's port of the game's
  `TTerrainXP` (`Assets/GFX/Shaders/FaTerrainShader.shader` in `D:\faf-development\FAForeverMapEditor`):
  the lower albedo, the strata by their masks (`clamp(mask * 2 - 1)`), the upper albedo by its alpha,
  each repeating every `AlbedoScale` ogrids, and the game's lighting (`CalculateXPLighting`
  without specular). Normals come from the heightmap per pixel; the strata's normal maps are not
  used (a fragment shader has 16 texture units).
  - The heightmap is a 16-bit integer texture read with `texelFetch`, the masks two colour
    textures of four layers each. A new document version uploads only the tiles that changed
    (`TiledBuffer.ChangedTiles`), so a stroke on an 81 km map shows within 0.2 s.
  - Textures (`GpuTextureCache`) are on the card once per file, whatever number of layers and
    decals use them; they are decoded on a pool thread (`GameTextures`, from the map's own files
    or the workspace's assets) and uploaded with the next frame. A texture whose source changes
    (a project file read again, an asset a tool saves: the view watches `assets/`) is loaded
    again; the old one shows until then. Textures no draw used are deleted.
  - Decals keep the map's order (which lies on top) and are drawn instanced: a run of decals with
    the same texture and size class is one draw (Seton's Clutch: 2230 decals, 48 textures, 523
    draws). A decal's position is its corner, and it turns around that corner. Normal decals
    (DXT5nm) change the lit colour below by the ratio of the light with and without them,
    blended as `2 × source × destination`, since the view has no deferred lighting.
  - The water is a surface at its elevation, drawn after the decals, darker and more opaque
    with depth down to the abyss elevation.
  - Uniforms of samplers must not share a texture unit with another sampler type: unit 0 holds
    the heights (`usampler2D`), 1 a decal's texture, 2 to 11 the layers, 12 and 13 the masks.
    A sampler with a mipmapped filter on a texture without mipmaps reads as black: the masks have
    their own sampler.
  - Avalonia's hit testing only finds what a control draws itself, and this one draws nothing
    through `Render`: it claims its whole rectangle (`ICustomHitTest`), or the mouse would fall
    through to the tab control. Check a new control with automation's `hit`.
- `Views/MainWindow`: menu (View: markers, path nodes, the 3D camera in the top view), status
  bar, the side panel (`Views/SidePanel`: brush for heights or a layer's mask, history), the Top
  and 3D tabs, and the pages of the start (`SetupPage`, `UpdateAssetsPage`, `ConvertingPage`);
  asks about unsaved changes before closing.
  `WindowDialogs` answers the view model's questions with the system's folder picker and a small
  save-changes dialog.
- The window watches the project folder (`ProjectWatcher`) and reads back what other tools change;
  during a stroke the changes wait until it ends.

## Tests with the real window, and labels for screen readers and agents

- `tests/FAForever.MapEditor.App.Tests/MainWindowTest` runs the real `MainWindow` without a screen
  (Avalonia.Headless with Skia): the mouse, wheel and keys as a person uses them, and frames of
  what it shows. Test input and views there: the camera's controls, control and a click in the
  top view, painting as one undo step, switching views. The headless platform has no graphics
  card, so the 3D view draws nothing and its camera does not glide by itself (the tests let it
  arrive); what it draws is checked with automation in a real editor. The tests of the 3D view's
  input also catch a view that the mouse does not reach.
- Give every control one can read or use a name for screen readers: `AutomationProperties.Name`
  (and `HelpText` where the use is not obvious) in the XAML, unless its own text says it (a
  button's content, a menu's header). `MainWindowTest.EveryControlOneCanUseHasALabelOrText`
  fails otherwise. Avalonia hands the names to Windows UI Automation (and the other systems'
  equivalents), and automation's `ui` returns them.

## Performance: finding out why it lags

`Diagnostics/Performance` measures named spans (`using Performance.Span measure =
Performance.Measure("3d.frame");`) and runs a watchdog that asks the user interface's thread to
answer every 50 ms: an answer 100 ms late or more is a stall, kept with the spans that ran
meanwhile; stalls of 250 ms or more go to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FAF Map Editor\performance.log`.
Automation's `perf` gives per span the count, total, mean, 95th percentile and longest, and the
recent stalls (`perf reset=true` starts over). Measure a change before and after, and put a span
around new work that may grow with the map: `3d.*` (the 3D view's frame and its parts),
`top.*`, `model.*`, `camera.smooth-ground`.

What it found, and the rules that came of it:
- Looking a texture up asks the file system (`File.Exists`, the time of the file); the 3D view
  drew 533 decal runs a frame and spent 33 of 35 ms doing so. It keeps the sources by path and
  looks them up again only when the map's files change or the asset watcher reports a change.
  Nothing per frame may touch the disk.
- The tab control takes the view of a hidden tab out of the tree, and the 3D view then drops its
  OpenGL context: every switch rebuilt the context, the heights, masks and textures (110 ms
  frames and stalls). The tabs only choose; both views stay in the tree and only their
  visibility changes (`MainWindow.OnViewChosen`).
- A hidden view does no work: the top view skips updating its picture while hidden and catches
  up when shown.

## Automation: driving the running editor

Started with `--automation <port>`, the editor takes commands over HTTP on
`http://localhost:<port>/` (`Automation/AutomationServer`): the operations of the menu, each run on
the user interface's thread and answered with the editor's state as JSON (title, map, modified,
undo/redo, history, brush, zoom). Use it to check a change in the real editor:

```sh
faf-map-editor tests/FAForever.FileFormats.Map.Tests/assets/maps/HardFFA.v0001 --automation 5371 &
faf-map editor state                                      # the CLI is the client
faf-map editor brush mode=Flatten radius=30 strength=1 target=6
faf-map editor stroke points=[[60,128],[196,128]]         # in ogrids; one undo step
faf-map editor height x=128 z=128
faf-map editor screenshot path=shot.png map=true          # then look at the PNG
faf-map editor undo
faf-map editor close                                      # closes without asking about changes
```

- The state's `gpu` says which OpenGL the 3D view runs on, its error if it could not start, the
  textures on the card, the last texture that could not be read, and the decals with their draws
  and textures.
- The state includes `busy` and `stage` (`SetUp`, `UpdateAssets`, `Converting`, `Ready`), with
  `workspace`, `setupError` and `assetReasons`; a command that opens, saves or converts answers
  when it is done. Start a test editor with `FAF_MAP_EDITOR_SETTINGS` set to a file of its own, so
  that its setup never changes the workspace the user's editor remembers.
- `ui {hidden?}` returns the window's controls as an agent needs them (`Automation/UiTree`): type,
  name (`x:Name`), label (`AutomationProperties.Name`), help, text or value (sliders, check boxes,
  selected tab, list item or combo box entry), whether enabled and focused, and the place in the
  window (`[x, y, width, height]`, for `hit` and the mouse). Layout without anything to read or
  use is left out, and a control's template is not opened up. Read it before guessing from a
  screenshot.
- Commands: `help`, `state`, `ui {hidden?}`, `perf {reset?}` (above), `setup {folder, game?, faf?, vault?}` (the setup page; fields left
  out keep what it suggests), `update-assets`, `open {path}`, `import {path}`, `save`, `save-as {path}`,
  `export {output, version?}`, `undo`, `redo`, `goto {step}`,
  `brush {layer?, mode?, radius?, strength?, target?, erase?}` (layer 0 the heights, 1 to 8 a mask), `mask {layer, x, z}`,
  `stroke {points}`, `height {x, z}`, `hit {x, y}` (the control the mouse reaches at a point of
  the window, with its parents), `fit`, `show {markers?, pathNodes?, camera?}`, `view {zoom, x, z}`,
  `tab {name: top|3d}`, `camera {x?, z?, distance?, yaw?, pitch?}` (the 3D view, degrees; at once),
  `focus {x, z, radius?}` (with a radius as F, gliding while the 3D view shows; without, as
  control and a click in the top view),
  `screenshot {path, map?, gpu?}` (`gpu: true` reads a frame of the 3D view back from the card:
  a screenshot of the window does not reach it), `gpu-debug {mode}` (what the 3D view's terrain
  shows: 0 the picture, 1 the albedo, 2 the light, 3 the normals, 4 the heights, 5 the lower
  layer, 6 the first four masks after the remap, 7 as stored),
  `close`. A new menu item gets a command here too.
- The method does not matter, and a command without arguments works as a GET
  (`curl localhost:5371/undo`); Windows refuses a POST without a body, so the CLI always sends one.
- It listens on the loopback address only and only when asked to. Commands do not show dialogs:
  `close` does not ask about unsaved changes.
- An MCP server for agents would be a thin layer over these same commands.
